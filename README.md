## CSS Solar System

Simple project for learning about CSS animations. This was based off of a Codeacademy course. 

## Code Example

Each planet is a div that gets wrapped around its orbit. The planets/orbits are centered using margins and then a simple keyframe animation rotates the orbit div.

```
<div id="mercury-orbit">
    <div id="mercury"></div>
</div>
```
